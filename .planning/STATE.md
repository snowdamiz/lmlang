# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-17)

**Core value:** AI agents can build, modify, and verify programs of arbitrary size with perfect local and global awareness
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Core Graph Data Model

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 9 (Core Graph Data Model)
Plan: 3 of 4 in current phase
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-02-18 — Completed 01-03-PLAN.md

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 8%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 4min
- Total execution time: 0.18 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 3/4 | 11min | 4min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (4min), 01-02 (4min), 01-03 (3min)
- Trend: stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 9 phases derived from 41 requirements following crate dependency graph and feature dependency tree
- [Roadmap]: Phases 2 and 3 both depend only on Phase 1 (could parallelize); Phase 4 depends on both 2 and 3
- [Roadmap]: Bidirectional dual-layer propagation deferred to Phase 8 (hardest correctness problem, per research)
- [Roadmap]: Incremental compilation grouped with full contract system (Phase 6) since both harden the working system
- [Phase 01]: No unsigned integer types -- follows LLVM approach (signedness at operation level)
- [Phase 01]: TypeId constants (BOOL through NEVER) as associated consts for ergonomic builtin access
- [Phase 01]: F32 ConstValue stored as f64 internally for float comparison safety in enum derives
- [Phase 01]: Types inferred from edges, not stored on ops -- follows LLVM model, eliminates redundancy
- [Phase 01]: Both high-level (IfElse, Loop, Match) and low-level (Branch, Jump, Phi) control flow ops included
- [Phase 01]: ModuleDef stub in node.rs with TODO(plan-03) for later migration to module.rs
- [Phase 01]: FunctionSummary (not full FunctionDef) in SemanticNode -- full def goes in separate lookup table
- [Phase 01]: Closures are FunctionDefs with is_closure=true and non-empty captures -- no separate closure type
- [Phase 01]: ModuleDef gains id field (ModuleId) in canonical definition vs the Plan 02 stub
- [Phase 01]: ModuleTree serde roundtrip uses structural comparison due to HashMap non-deterministic key ordering

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Op node set needs careful mapping to LLVM IR targets before Phase 1 implementation
- [Research]: Agent tool API schema design is novel -- test with real LLMs early in Phase 4
- [Research]: Bidirectional propagation (Phase 8) has no production precedent -- needs formal specification before implementation

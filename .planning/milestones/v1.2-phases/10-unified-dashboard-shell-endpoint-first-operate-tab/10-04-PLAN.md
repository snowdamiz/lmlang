<objective>
Add a milestone-level documentation pass that fully captures the unified dashboard and endpoint-first Operate model.

Purpose: Ensure all docs and README are aligned with implemented Phase 10 behavior before moving to later phases.
Output: Updated README, new dashboard/operator docs, API reference docs, and synchronized planning verification notes.

  <name>Task 1: Update README and add operator workflow documentation</name>
  <files>
    README.md
    docs/dashboard-operator-guide.md
  </files>
  <action>
    Update README sections to describe:
    - unified dashboard route and high-level architecture
    - Operate vs Observe responsibilities
    - local run/test flow for dashboard work

    Add a dedicated operator guide with step-by-step workflows:
    - register/select agent
    - configure run setup (template + prompt)
    - execute lock/mutation/verify/simulate/compile/history operations
    - switch to Observe for graph/query inspection
    - troubleshoot common lock and active-program errors
  </action>
  <verify>
    Manual review confirms README and guide are internally consistent and actionable for first-time operators.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Users can discover and execute the dashboard workflow from docs alone.
  </done>

  </files>
  <action>
    Create endpoint reference docs for Operate-related APIs with:
    - route/method tables
    - required headers and payload fields
    - representative request/response examples
    - known Phase 10 limitations and Phase 11/12 deferred behaviors

    Update project planning docs to keep milestone narrative, requirements coverage, and verification evidence aligned with final documentation and implementation outputs.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Documentation cross-check ensures endpoint references match router/handler behavior and planning docs reflect final Phase 10 scope.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Milestone documentation is complete, coherent, and synchronized with code and plans.
  </done>
</task>

1. README documents unified dashboard usage and architecture clearly
2. docs/dashboard-operator-guide.md provides end-to-end operator workflow instructions
3. docs/api/operator-endpoints.md accurately reflects routed endpoints and header requirements
4. Planning documents and 10-VERIFICATION.md align with final documented behavior
5. Documentation explicitly identifies what is deferred to Phase 11 and Phase 12
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Milestone has complete user/developer-facing documentation for Phase 10 capabilities
- Docs are consistent with implemented endpoint-first strategy
- README and planning records remain reliable entry points for next-phase work
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/10-unified-dashboard-shell-endpoint-first-operate-tab/10-04-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
